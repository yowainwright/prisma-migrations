## What is Prisma Migrations?

Prisma Migrations adds the rollback functionality and programmatic control that Prisma's native migrations lack, while maintaining 100% compatibility with Prisma's standard migration system. Write your migrations in TypeScript or JavaScript with full type safety and run them from your code.

## Why Prisma Migrations?

### The Problem

Prisma's native `prisma migrate` is excellent for forward migrations, but has critical limitations:

- **No rollback support**: Once a migration is applied, there's no built-in way to undo it
- **No programmatic API**: You can't run migrations from your JavaScript runtime code
- **Limited control**: Can't run specific numbers of migrations or interactive selection
- **SQL-only migrations**: No way to write migrations in TypeScript/JavaScript with type safety

When you need to rollback a migration in production or run migrations programmatically during deployment, you're stuck with manual SQL or third-party tools that don't integrate with Prisma.

### The Solution

Prisma Migrations extends Prisma with powerful features while staying 100% compatible:

```typescript
// Write migrations in TypeScript with full type safety
import type { PrismaClient } from 'prisma-migrations';

export async function up(prisma: PrismaClient) {
  await prisma.$executeRaw`
    CREATE TABLE users (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
      name VARCHAR(255),
      created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
    )
  `;
}

export async function down(prisma: PrismaClient) {
  await prisma.$executeRaw`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users`;
}
```

Run migrations from your code:

```typescript
import { Migrations } from 'prisma-migrations';
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

const prisma = new PrismaClient();
const migrations = new Migrations(prisma);

// Run all pending migrations
await migrations.up();

// Rollback last migration
await migrations.down();
```

Or use the CLI:

```bash
# Run migrations
npx prisma-migrations up

# Rollback migrations
npx prisma-migrations down

# Interactive mode
npx prisma-migrations up --interactive
```

## Key Features

- **Rollback migrations**: Full `up` and `down` migration support
- **TypeScript/JavaScript migrations**: Write migrations in TS/JS with full type safety
- **Programmatic API**: Run migrations from your Node.js code
- **Prisma compatible**: Uses Prisma's standard `_prisma_migrations` table
- **Step control**: Run or rollback specific numbers of migrations
- **Interactive mode**: Select which migrations to apply
- **Zero configuration**: Works out of the box with any Prisma project

## Benefits

- **Safe deployments**: Rollback problematic migrations in production
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript support for migration code
- **Flexibility**: Run migrations programmatically during CI/CD or app startup
- **Compatible**: Works alongside `prisma migrate` commands
- **Developer enhanced**: Interactive mode for development workflows
